            <h2>The Cardio</h2>
            <p>
                One's choice in cardio is typically flexible as you can do any exercise(s) of your choice that can sustain 
                your heart rate above a certain threshold for a certain period of time. Cardio can be divided into two categories:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)</li>
                <li>Steady-State Cardio</li>
            </ul>

                <h3>HIIT</h3>
                <p>
                    HIIT is a type of cardio that is performed explosively. With this type of cardio, one should aim to keep their 
                    heart rate above 80% of their max heart rate. It can be performed with any type of exercise where one can sustain 
                    such a heart rate for short bursts of time. These workouts are generally shorter than steady-state cardio workouts. 
                    For optimal results, total workout time can range from 10 to 30 minutes including warm-up and cooldown depending 
                    on the intensity at which the workout is performed. Examples include sprints, burpees, box jumps, bodyweight 
                    squats, skipping, etc.

                <h3>Steady-State Cardio</h3>
                <p>
                    Steady-state cardio is generally low to moderate intensity cardio that is performed over a longer period of time. 
                    With steady-state, one should aim to maintain a heart rate between 60% to 80% of their max heart rate. For optimal 
                    results, total workout can range from 30 to 45 minutes. Examples include jogging, swimming, cycling, rowing, 
                    elliptical machine, stepping machine, etc.
